# Background

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program in New York has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

I analyzed the data of the Citi Bike service from 2017 to 2020 to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the usage and profiles of customers.

# Approach

* Merged [monthly data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) from 2017 to 2020. 

* Visualized the usage and profile data in Tableau. [Deployed here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/megan.mcglashan#!/vizhome/CitiBikeAnalysis_16029550768170/Covid-19ImpactonUsage).

# Findings 

## Impact of COVID-19 on usage

As one would expect, there were changes in the usage of the City Bike service that coincided with COVID-19 events. Use amoung subscribers decline in March and April. Though usage has since picked up across consumer types, levels have remained 2019 levels amoung subscribers. Comparatively, usage amoung customer has increased three-fold compared to 2019.
